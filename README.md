# Cloud Storage Simulator
This application simulates a Cloud Storage Application. Initially, the user will choose a package (for maximum storage capacity) and then proceed to register (or log in if the user already has an account). Then the user will gain access to the application where they can upload, edit and delete files from their "remote" storage. In reality, the files will be stored locally, but they will be managed by the MinIO storage server giving the illusion that they are stored remotely.
